          My name's Magdalena Rosłaniec but I like my internet nickname: makneta.
          I'm a teacher, mother and self-taught developer who wants to change
          her career into programming.

          I live in a medium size town in the north-east Poland. I love my small
          fatherland, it's a peaceful place, full of lakes and forests, where I
          enjoy running, nordic walking and riding a bike in my free time.

          I started my adventure with programming in September 2017 and since
          then I've been slowly but steadily learning Python and Django. I've
          learnt also a bit of SQL, JavaScript and C++ but Python is deeply in
          my heart. My other passion is art, so I sometimes "draw" in CSS for
          pleasure.
